        <!--I originally made these buttons' onclick events be handled in javascript and that caused a lot of problems before I found a solution
        It would call functions multiple times which didn't affect 'createContent' because additional submit button is required to make changes
        but it took my an incredibly long time to figure out why toggle function was getting called 4 times-->
